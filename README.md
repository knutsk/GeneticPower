# Calculating Power of Genetic Association Studies with the GeneticPower R Package

This package provides east-to-use functions for calculating genetic power, sample sizes, and required effect sizes for genetic association tests for binary and quantitative phenotypes. 
This documentation will take you through some examples for both study types.

### Binary Traits

Let's consider an example using a binary trait. Suppose we are designing a genetic association study for hypertension in a European study population... etc.
